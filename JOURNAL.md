I am BACK from a long break from highway. I had a lot of exams, but here I am. I deal with a lot of fire. whether it be a lighter or actual gas during camping or something, I'm around fire. So having safety measures with gas leaks is very important. Thats why I wanted to build noLeaks! It's a gas leak detector that uses an arduino nano and sends a call to your phone when there is a gas detected.
