I am BACK from a long break from highway. I had a lot of exams, but here I am. I deal with a lot of fire. whether it be a lighter or actual gas during camping or something, I'm around fire. So having safety measures with gas leaks is very important. Thats why I wanted to build noLeaks! It's a gas leak detector that uses an arduino nano and sends a call to your phone when there is a gas detected.

In this session, I found the parts I needed. But first, I planned out how the gas detector will work. Essentially, I wanted some kind of component to detect gas from a lighter or something similar, and call my phone through a sim card module. I would also like it to have a small oled screen telling on it when its calling someone and that gas was detected. While this may seem kinda useless, I wanted it so that I can also see that it was detected in the rare case that my phone is unreachable or it is turned off.

I decided I wanted an Arduino Nano, A sim 900 module, a 0.91 inch OLED display, as well as a LPG detector (likely a MQ135).

So I started the schematic.
